    <ol>
        <li>If SenderId is specified in OracleAQMessage object while enqueuing, the 
            sender id of dequeued message will have &quot;@ODP.NE&quot; appended in the end. [Bug 
            7315542]<br /><br /></li>

        <li>An &quot;ORA-00942: table or view does not exist&quot; error may be thrown from Dequeue or 
            DequeueArray method invocations when OracleAQDequeueOptions.DeliveryMode is 
            specified as OracleAQMessageDeliveryMode.Buffered and 
            OracleAQDequeueOptions.Correlation is specified and there are no messages 
            available in the queue. [Bug 7343633]<br />

    <a name="EF"><h2>Entity Framework Tips, Limitations, and Known Issues</h2>
    This section contains Entity Framework related information that pertains to both ODP.NET, Managed Driver and ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver.
    <ol>
        <li>Interval Day to Second and Interval Year to Month column values cannot be 
            compared to literals in a WHERE clause of a LINQ to Entities or an Entity SQL 
            query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>LINQ to Entities and Entity SQL (ESQL) queries that require the usage of SQL 
            APPLY in the generated queries will cause SQL syntax error(s) if the Oracle 
            Database being used does not support APPLY. In such cases, the inner exception 
            message will indicate that APPLY is not supported by the database.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>ODP.NET does not currently support wildcards that accept character ranges for 
            the LIKE operator in Entity SQL (i.e. [] and [^]). [Bug 11683837]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>ODP.NET does not support Code First nor DbContext APIs.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>Executing LINQ or ESQL query against tables with one or more column names 
            that are close to or equal to the maximum length of identifiers (30 bytes) may 
            encounter &quot;ORA-00972: identifier is too long&quot; error, due to the usage of alias 
            identifier(s) in the generated SQL that exceed the limit.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got NCLOB&quot; error will be 
            encountered when trying to bind a string that is equal to or greater than 2,000 
            characters in length to an XMLType column or parameter. [Bug 12630958]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932 : inconsistent datatypes&quot; error can be encountered if a string of 
            2,000 or more characters, or a byte array with 4,000 bytes or more in length, is 
            bound in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query. The same error can be encountered 
            if an entity property that maps to a BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, LONG, LONG RAW, XMLTYPE 
            column is used in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow&quot; exception can be 
            encountered when fetching numeric values that have more precision than what the 
            .NET type can support. In such cases, the LINQ or ESQL query can &quot;cast&quot; the 
            value to a particular .NET or EDM type to limit the precision and avoid the 
            exception. This approach can be useful if the LINQ/ESQL query has 
            computed/calculated columns which will store up to 38 precision in Oracle, which 
            cannot be represented as .NET decimal unless the value is casted. <br /><br /></li>
        <li>Oracle Database treats NULLs and empty strings the same. When executing string 
            related operations on NULLS or empty strings, the result will be NULL. When 
            comparing strings with NULLs, use the equals operator (i.e. &quot;x == NULL&quot;) in the 
            LINQ query, which will in turn use the &quot;IS NULL&quot; condition in the generated SQL 
            that will appropriately detect NULL-ness.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>If an exception message of &quot;The store provider factory type 
            &#39;Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory&#39; does not implement the 
            IServiceProvider interface.&quot; is encountered when executing an Entity Framework 
            application with ODP.NET, the machine.config requires and entry for ODP.NET 
            under the &lt;DbProviderFactories&gt; section. To resolve this issue by adding an 
            entry in the machine.config, reinstall ODAC.</li>
